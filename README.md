# Blob Counter
## Details
This program counts the number of blobs on the screen based of a threshold value in RGB.

## Setup
open up a commandline and run:
```
pip3 install cv2
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install tk
pip3 install pillow
```

## Usage

Place pictures into a folder called "<blob counter repo>/input_images/"

so the file system looks like this:
```
<blob counter repo>/input_images/example1.jpeg
                                /example2.jpeg
                   /counter.py
                   /README.md
```

Then run:
```
python3 counter.py
```
